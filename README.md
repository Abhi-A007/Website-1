## How to run the website ?

First of all, you will need to install the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

When Python is installed, open the Terminal and install the latest version of Django:

```
pip install django
```

You can then clone this repo and go into it with:

```
cd Website/
```

Finally you must execute this command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

The default port is 8000, so you can access to the website with the address:

```
http://localhost:8000
or
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Have fun!
